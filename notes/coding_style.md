## File Layout
* File sections should be arranged in the following order
1. File Description, *Example:*
	*	```C
		/*
    		@author : nickname
   			@brief : file description
		*/
		```
2. Headers
    * Global
    * Local
3. Macros
4. Types
5. Global Variables
6. Functions
- Each seaction(e.g. file description, declarations, functions, macros...) should be seperated with 2 lines while the elements(like one function from another) within it should be seperated with one line or no lines. *Example:*
	*	```C
		int foo; // Section 1


		int foobar(); // Section 2

		int foofoo(); // Section 2, element 2
		```



## Indentation
* Use 4 spaces as tab.
* **DO NOT** use space as an indentation
* Try no to leave white spaces at the end of lines
* Do not put multiple assignments or statements on a single line

- *Example:*

	* **DON'T**
		```C
			if (condition) do_this;
			do_something_everytime;

			something; something;
		```
	* **DO**
		```C
			if (condition)
				do this;
				do_something_everytime;

			something;
			something;
		```



## Blocks
* `{` and `}` are on their own lines, except on `do while` statements. *Example:*
	* 	```C
			if (cond)
			{
				// ...
			}
			else
			{
				// ...
			}

			do
			{
				// ...
			} while (cond);
		```
* Do not unnecessarily use braces where a single statement will do, unless only one brach of conditional statement is single statement, in latter case use braces in both branches. *Example:*
	*	```C
			if (condition)
				action();

			if (condition)
			{
				do_this();
				do_that();
			}
			else
			{
				otherwise();
			}
		```



## Spaces
* Use spaces after `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`, `case`, `do`
* Do not use spaces after `sizeof`
* Do not use space after the opening ( and before the closing )
* Use one space on each side of `=  +  -  <  >  *  /  %  |  &  ^  <=  >=  ==  !=  ?  :`
* Do not use space after unary `&  *  +  -  ~  !  sizeof  typeof  alignof  __attribute__  defined`, `++  --` or `. ->`



## Comments
* Put all of the code description near the code and not above or below it, except for header files where comments could be located anywhere or comments that describe algorithms *Example:*
	* If the comment talks about multiple lines use /* */
		*	```c
			int this;				/* Declares a variable for use as a condition and prints hello */
			if (this)
				printf("hello");
	* If the comment talks about one line of code use //
		*	```c
			int this; 				// A variable declaration
			```
	*	```c
			while (condition)	// This does something <-- CORRECT COMMENT
				if (this == this)
					do_something();

			// This does something	<-- WRONG COMMENT
			while (condition)
				if (this == this)
					do_something();
		```
* Use the special formating for the function comments and keep all function comments in the header file. *Example:*
	* 	```C
			/*
				@brief : function description
				@param parameter-name : parameter description
				@param paramter-name2 : parameter description
				@return : return values of the function
			*/
		```

* If the comment describes some smart(hard to understand)/special algorithm the comment could be located above the code and should use /* */ comments
	*	```c
			/*
				A lot of algorithm explanation
				...
			*/
			int this
			for (i = 0; i < 9, i++)
				printf("%d", this);
		```



## Functions
* Do not use more then 10 local variables
* All functions that would be used globally should be seperated from local in a seperate header file and be declared as extern
* All local functions should be declared static
* Return type and modifiers on the same line as the function name.
* *Example:*
	* 	```C
		static void foo()
		{
			bar;
		}
		```



## Headers
* All headers must include a header guard e.g.
	* 	```c
			#ifndef HEADER_NAME_TYPE_H
			#define HEADER_NAME_TYPE_H
			// All of the header contents
			#endif
		```
	* Global(headers that are included by files other then the .c file corresponding to the header) header's defines should look like e.g. `VMM_GLOBAL_H`, while local(headers only included by the corresponding .c file and that have only static functions) should be `VMM_LOCAL_H`

* All of the following must not be in .c files, but in .h files - `struct defines`, `macros`, `function prototypes`, `typedefs`
