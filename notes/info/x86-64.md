# [Long Mode](https://wiki.osdev.org/X86-64)
## Guide(personal understanding)
### Check Long Mode availability using CPUID
1. [The presence of CPUID should be checked(otherwise imposible to know if long mode is available so fail)](https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Long_Mode#Detection_of_CPUID)
2. If the CPUID is present the presence of CPUID extended functions should be checked(if missing fail for same reaseon as before)
3. [Finally if CPUID and it's extended functions are present the presence of the long mode should be checked in the CPUID extended functions flags](https://wiki.osdev.org/Setting_Up_Long_Mode#x86_or_x86-64)


### GDT setup for x86-64
- The GDT should be loaded with code and data segments with different access rights, but that just span over the whole memory range making physical addresses directly mapped to virtual
- [Global Descriptor Table](https://wiki.osdev.org/Global_Descriptor_Table) - it was used for segmentation in protected mode when it was only invented, but now is always set to flat memory model(all virtual addresses map directly to physical)
	* **Flat memory mode:** in flat memory model all the virtual addresses are mapped direcotry to physical, this is done because both the data and code selectors span through all of the 4 GB space meaning that any access could be done to any address
	* **Limit** - spans through two fields so the first field is set to 0xffff and second(located later) is set to 0xf and together they make up a number that when multiplied by 4096(size of unit if granularity bit is set) is 4 Billion meaning that selector describes all 4 GB
	* **Base** - base also spans throgh two fields which both should be 0 on both selectors because the selectors start at 0x0 and span to the end of the memory(4 GB, as described in previous sentance)
	* **Access** - Access is the only field that differs because the executable bit is set on code selector and off on data other bits are just what they should be for descrptor to work
	* **Flags** - in the flags the granularity bit should be set so the limit is measured in 4KiB units and not in bytes and bits that depend on it(the one near) should also be set/off


### Switch from protected mode to long mode(Intel Developer Manual - p. 3131(9.8.5))
1. Disable protected mode paging(clear paging bit) - `CR0.PG = 0`
2. Enable PAE(set PAE bit) - `CR4.PAE = 1`
3. Load CR3 with address of level 4 page table(PML4)
4. Enable long mode(set long mode biy in EFER model specific register) - `IA32_EFER.LME = 1`(Read on how to write/read model specific registers to do it)
5. Enable paging(set paging bit) - `CR0.PG = 1`
6. After enabling everything before the CPU is in compatibility mode which is still 32 bit and to make the final switch it should load the new 64-Bit GDT instead of the old one for the 32bit/protected mode(The 64bit GDT has some differences in bit meanings - described in Intel Manual 3.4.5)
7. There should be a long jump(using code selector offset as offset) to the 64-Bit code and then the CPU is finally in long mode


### Long Mode Switch Caveats
* [Red Zone             - ABI of 64-bit mode, that has to be taken into account not to overwrite ISRs](https://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?t=21720)
* [Linker script notes  - how common can brake the kernel](https://forum.osdev.org/viewtopic.php?p=170634)



## Information
* Bootstrap paging - when switching to long mode no VMM(virtual memory manager) or anything hard is needed to use paging, but the addresses where the kernel is located(1MB + kernel_size) should be mapped on the physical memory. Easy way to map is just to identity map the first 1GB of memory by using huge(1GB) pages and mapping one page to the start of memory(1GB). Later, once in long mode with full kernel loaded the tables that identity map the first GB could be changed by loading new address in cr3 and setting up normal paging
* Paging on x86 - a series of tables(amount depends on the mode) are used to map pages. Each table has 512 entries which point to a table of lower level and the last table's entries point to pages. In some of the tables individual(one by one and not all at once) entries could be changed from pointing to a whole table, to point to just one page of a size of the whole table.
	* It is recommended to map kernel at `address + 1MB` and use the address to map the first MB of RAM which is used for UEFI/BIOS
* [Noncanonical Addresses and the big gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64#Virtual_address_space_details) - on x86_64 only 47/55 bits are used in addresses and the manual states that bits 48-63/56-63 should be the same as 47/55th bit and that means that techinically bit 48/56 is available(as all last bits techinically act as the last bit of the address) and that means that in addition to the first 256 TiB(in 48 bit addressing, in 56-Bit it would be more), the last 256 TiB are also accessible and between them there is a gigantic hole of addresses that could not be accessed(or otherwise bits 48-63/56-63 would not be the same as 47/55th bit), the size of the hole decreases as more bits of address are used(when using 56-Bit addressing, the hole is smaller then when using 47-Bit addressing)
	* Canonical Lower Half - the first 256TiB(In 48-Bit addressing, in 56-Bit it would be more) that could be accessed
	* Noncanonical addresses - addresses that could not be accessed because of the the restriction where unused bits should be the same as the last used(47/57)
	* Canonical Higher Half - the last 256TiB(In 48-Bit addressing, in 56-Bit it would be more) that could be accessed
		* Higher Half starts at address 0xffffffff80100000(in 48-bit addressing)
	* The non-canonical address hole - When addresses 0x0 - 0x7FFF’FFFF’FFFF are represented in binary the bit 47 is 0 and as a consequence bits 48-63 are also zeroes as they should be copies of bit 47, when the last bits are zero they do not change the number so the addresses 0x0 - 0x7FFF’FFFF’FFFF stay the same and are not impacted by the rule stating 48:63 are copies of 47. But the next address after 0x7FFF’FFFF’FFFF is 0x8000’0000’0000 which in binary has bit 47 set, which means that bits 48:63 are also set(1) and when they are 1 that impacts how the number will look in hex/decimal - the first number where the bits 47:64 are set is 0xFFFF’8000’0000’0000 which is in last 128 TiB range, so it makes it impossible to have any addresses that are above 0x7FFF’FFFF’FFFF that are not in the last 128 TiB range, as setting bits 47:63 automatically throws the address to the last 128 TiB mark. Because of the rule only first and last 128 TiB could be accessed as the first 128 TiB have bits 47:63 off and last 128 TiB have bits 47:63 on

## Questions
### Current
### Solved
- Long Mode
	+ How do i check that red-zone was disabled and long mode was enabled on running OS?
		* Write largest possible 64 bit value into RAX and check if the full value stays there(if yes - long mode switch happened)
	+ When portions of assembly code are `[BITS 32]` and some are `[BITS 64]` what should the output format of assembler be(e.g. elf64/elf32)?
		* The section would be converted in any case of output format(does not matter which is output - e.g. elf32/64...), the output format for binary that would switch to long mode should be `elf64`
	+ Should the linkerscript changes be made for the reason above(parts of code with different bitness)?
		* No
	+ Should grub be changed to load elf64 binary?
		* No
	+ Will protected mode variables still work in long mode?
		* No




# Interrupt Handling
## Enabling interrupts
* [APIC should be setup and detected(fail if there is no APIC as OS if only for new PCs) before using the interrupts](https://wiki.osdev.org/APIC)
1. Disable interrupts - `cli`
2. Make a list of IDT entries(there could be a maxiumum of 256(0...255) entries as that is the amount of interrupts, but there could be less) - each entry is the struct described in (VOL3, 6.14, 6-18)
	* Example C implementation
		*	```C
			struct IDTentry
			{
				uint16_t offset_1; 	// offset bits 0..15(the first 16 bits of the interrupt handler address)
				uint16_t selector;	// a code segment selector in GDT or LDT(normally is 0x8 as it is mostly the code segment)
				uint16_t type_attr; // type and attributes - Bit meanings: 0:2 - IST(VOL3, 6.14.5), 3:7 - should be zero, 8:11 - type(described in VOL3, 3.5, 3-14), 12 - 0, 13:14 - describes priviledge(VOL3 3.4.2), 15 - present(should be 1 if the entry point to a valid handler)
				uint32_t offset_3; 	// offset bits 32..63(the last 32 bits of the interrupt handler address)
				uint32_t zero;     	// reserved(should be zero)
			};
			```
3. Initialise the IDT descriptor/pointer whos address would be loaded into IDT register(and it would point to the IDT list). The format of the IDT descriptor structure is described in (VOL3, 6.10, 6-10)
	* Example C implementation
		*	```C
			struct IDTdesc
			{
				uint64_t base;	// Address of the start of array of IDT entries
				uint16_t limit;	// The size of the IDT array - IDT_entries_count * IDT_size - 1
			};
			```



## Resources
- [APIC](https://wiki.osdev.org/APIC)
	* LAPIC(Local APIC) - manages interrupts for one CPU core and is a more advanced version of PIC
	* I/O APIC - main APIC that controls and sends interrupts to the Local APICs
- Intel VOL. 3, Chapter 6, 10
- Test
	* Bind interrupt 33 to some handler
	* The handler should indicate to APIC that the interrupt is finished
	* The handler use iretq to finish interrupt
	* Call interrupt 33, if fails try to call 32(maybe because of zero it is -1)
	* THE INTERRUPT HANDLER SHOULD NOT RETURN TO IT'S CALLER OR IT WILL FAIL
		* The interrupt should call interruptOccurred which should call handler then handler ret's to it and the interruptOccured the indicates to APIC the interrupt is finished and iretq



## Questions
- How do differenciate between exeotions and interrupts if they are attatched to the same interrupt vector?
- Is my Interrupt setup correct?
- 0...31 entries are reserved, which means that I can map handlers(but not use for anything general purpose) the ones that are for faults and do nothing with ones marked as reserved, am I right?
- If the PS/2 sends interrupt on vector 1(which is use by some exeption/fault), will it arrive at 32(as it is the first free one), if no then how do I know when exeption arrives and when keyboard click is made?
- The exeption and normal interrupts are mapped to same interrupt vectors by default and I should remap the interrupts to start from 32 and catch exeption on 1-31 and interrupts at 32(which is really 1)-255 so they don't intersect. Am i right?
	* If yes, then should I do it with APIC and will it remap only interrupt or exeptions also?
	* Does this mean that the interrupt amount is decreased by 32?
